## Preparing Breadcrumbs


### Break 6 to 7 slices of breads and add in a mixer or dry grinder. Grind to a semi-fine consistency and do not make it floury or powdery.

### Take the bread crumbs in a plate or bowl. Keep aside. Skip this part if you have breadcrumbs.


## Preparing Veggies


### Now rinse and steam or boil 3 medium to large potatoes, 1 medium carrot, 8 to 9 french beans and ⅓ cup peas till they are completely cooked. You can cook or steam the vegetables in a stove-top pressure cooker, Instant Pot or a pan. I have listed the methods below.

### 1: Stove-top pressure cooker: Peel and chop potatoes, carrots and beans. Place them with the green peas in a pan or bowl. Add 2 cups water in a 3 litre pressure cooker. Place a small trivet inside. Place the bowl with the veggies on the trivet. Pressure cook for 10 to 12 minutes on medium-heat. Let the pressure fall naturally in the cooker and then only remove the lid.

### 2: Instant pot cooking: Pour 1.5 cups water in the steel insert of 6 quart IP. Keep a trivet inside the steel insert. Place the whole potatoes, carrots, beans in a steamer pan or on the trivet. Take green peas in a small bowl and place it on the steamer pan or on the trivet. Pressure cook for 10 to 12 minutes until veggies are tender. Let the pressure release naturally.

### 3: Cooking in a pan: Peel and chop potatoes, carrots in small cubes. Chop the beans to small pieces. Place the chopped veggies and green peas in a pan. Add water just about covering the vegetables. Cover and simmer on medium-low flame until veggies are fork tender.

### Peel and roughly chop the potatoes when warm. Also peel the cooked carrots and finely chop them. Finely chop the french beans too.

### Then mash the potatoes with a potato masher.

### When the mashed potatoes cools down completely, add the chopped carrots and beans. Also add the steamed peas.

### Mix everything well and keep aside.

### Then finely chop the onion and crush garlic, ginger and green chilies in a mortar-pestle. Set aside. You can crush them together or separately.


## Making Vegetable Patty Mixture


### Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a pan. Add the ginger-garlic-green-chili paste. Sauté for some seconds till the raw aroma of ginger and garlic goes away.

### Add the chopped onions. Stir and saute till the onion turns translucent or light brown.

### Add coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder, red chili powder or cayenne pepper and turmeric powder.

### Stir and mix the spices with the rest of the mixture.

### Switch off the flame and then add the chopped coriander leaves or parsley.

### Stir very well and add this sauteed onion mixture to the mashed veggies.

### Add salt and bread crumbs. Begin to mix very well.

### Keep the veggie patty mixture aside. Check the seasonings and add more of the ground spices and salt if needed.

### Make the veggie patties as same as the size of the burger buns. Keep aside. If the mixture looks soft or crumbles, then do add some more breadcrumbs and mix everything again very well. Cover the veggie patties and set aside.

### Preparing Mayo Dressing And Toppings

### Take mayonnaise in a small mixing bowl.

### Add ground mustard seed and freshly crushed black pepper

### Add lemon juice. You can also lemon juice as per your taste.

### Add apple cider vinegar or white vinegar and extra virgin olive oil or olive oil.

### Season with sugar. Also add salt

### Whisk the dressing very well. Keep aside.

### Also chop onion, tomato and cucumber in thin slices. Shred or chop some 4 to 5 small lettuce leaves or cabbage leaves.


## Making Batter


### In a medium sized mixing bowl take add makki ka atta, polenta or cornmeal , rice flour and gram flour (besan) or chickpea flour. Instead of gram flour & rice flour, you can also use 2 tbsp of all purpose flour.

### Add water. Stir and mix everything to a smooth batter without any lumps. The batter is of medium consistency. Keep aside.

### Pan Frying Patties

### Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil for pan frying the patties in a bowl. When the oil becomes medium hot, dip the patty in the batter.

### Coat evenly with the batter.

### Place the batter coated vegetable patty on the breadcrumbs. Dredge the patty evenly with the breadcrumbs. You can repeat the breading method twice for more crispiness.
 
### Place the breaded veggie patty in the medium hot oil. Bread another veggie patty in the same way and place it also in the pan. Depending on the size of your pan, you can fry from 2 to 4 patties. The veggie mixture makes 4 regular burger sized patties.

### 2 to 3 tablespoons oil works perfectly for frying two patties. For 4 veggie patties, you can add 4 to 6 tablespoons oil.

### When the base is lightly browned or browned, then flip the patties.

### Flip a couple of times more till the patties are pan fried evenly and the crust becomes crisp and golden.

### Drain the veggie patties on kitchen paper towels.


## Assembling Veggie Burger


### Slice the burger buns in equal halves.

### Spread some butter on the burger bun slices.

### Heat a small pan and toast the butter side.

### The buttered side should become lightly crisp and golden. Toast all the burger buns this way.

### Now spread the mayonnaise dressing on the crisp side.

### Place the vegetable patty.

### Top up with sliced veggies like onion slices, tomato slices or cucumber slices.

### Spread some mayonnaise dressing on the second halve of the burger bun and top up with some shredded or chopped lettuce or cabbage leaves.

### Place the burger buns on top of each other.

### Your veggie burger is ready. Make all veg burgers this way.


## Serving Suggestions


### Once your veggie burgers are assembled, serve them immediately with tomato ketchup, mustard sauce and some French Fries or Potato Wedges.

### If you don’t have tomatoes and cucumbers, sliced avocado or Guacamole works as a great topping as well.

### Or you can use grated carrots or coleslaw as a topping alternative. These veggie burgers are great snacks, but they are also filling enough to be a tasty lunch too. This burger recipe makes four regular sized veggie burgers.
